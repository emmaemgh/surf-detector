Predicts crowd based on given conditions. There is a sub directory for each spot. 

In order to get data for a particular spot, you will need to run the server continously using 2 different terminals as multithreading has not yet been implemented. 

Here is an example to collect data for Malibu. Both are in the "malibu" directory: 

Terminal 1: 

    python3 runCam.py

Terminal 2:

    python3 addData.py
